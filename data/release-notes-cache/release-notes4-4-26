									Neo4j 4.4.26 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.

<h3>Cypher</h3>
<ul>
<li>Track memory of de-referenced nodes and relationships in <code>ProduceResult</code>. This fix will avoid some out of memory errors in queries that returns lots of nodes or relationships. For example in queries like <code>MATCH (n) RETURN collect(n)</code>. When returning entities, all their properties and labels will be populated in <code>ProduceResult</code> operator which can cause lots of memory allocations. Before this change we would not track this memory towards the transaction limits.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clustering</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Remove transaction size limit in Raft. Before this change, large transactions could be written to the raft log but not read. This could lead to unexpected behaviours, for example a leader could stop sending entries to its followers.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Browser</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix plan view for DbHits over 32 bit integer max</li>
<li>Handle more database states</li>
<li>Expand completion detail by default</li>
<li>Ensure sso access token is always refreshed on expiry</li>
</ul>
