									Neo4j 4.4.30 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.

<h3>Cypher</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue in pipelined runtime that could cause a query to perform unnecessary work if planned with a PruningVarExpand operator followed by a Limit.</li>
<li>Improve the transaction termination response time of queries with long running expansions of variable-length path patterns with distinct end-nodes.</li>
<li>Wrap internal parser errors in SyntaxException and improve EOF error message<br>
This way, the errors will have the Neo4j status Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError instead of Neo.Database.General.UnknownError, meaning they will stop polluting the debug log.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clustering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue in store copy that could cause store inconsistencies in rare cases. In these cases the transaction range after a store copy was calculated too small, leading to misaligned store files after recovery. With this change the range should be safely calculated.</li>
</ul>
