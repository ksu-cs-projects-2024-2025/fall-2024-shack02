									Neo4j 4.3.4 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.
<h3>Highlights</h3>

<ul>
   <li>Fixes an issue where neo4j-admin copy would not complete if there were “enough” deleted node records from the source database. The copy would hang in sorting the sourceDbNodeId –&gt; targetDbNodeId data structure.</li>
   <li>Transform all hostname characters to lower case</li>
   <li>Fixes a bug in consistency checker for composite node indexes with lucene+native-3.0 index provider. Consistency checker reported index inconsistencies for all entries in the index even though the values were correctly indexed</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug where using length() in CYPHER 3.5 mode through Fabric would result in an error.</li>

</ul>
