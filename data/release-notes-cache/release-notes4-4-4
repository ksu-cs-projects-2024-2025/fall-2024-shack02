									Neo4j 4.4.4 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.
<h3>Highlights</h3>

<ul>
   <li>Improved performance of queries containing UNWIND and CALL IN TRANSACTIONS</li>
   <li>Update netty to 4.1.73.Final to address CVE-2021-43797. Whilst the affected code is not used, this will prevent it from incorrectly flagging it in security scanning tools.</li>
   <li>Fix a memory leak of the runtime transactional context into the query plan cache</li>
   <li>Fix an issue where ExpandInto can call get degrees on a dense node when DENY privileges are present. This causes a large amount of unnecessary permissions checks to occur.</li>
    <li>Introduce access-mode header for Transactional HTTP API.</li>

</ul>
