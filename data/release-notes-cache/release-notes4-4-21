									Neo4j 4.4.21 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.

<h3>Kernel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix issue where consistency check could take a very long time during index check if the store had very large string or array properties. This was due to internal caches growing a lot and subsequently taking a very long time to clear.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cypher</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduce memory footprint of cached queries with lots of expressions.</li>
<li>Fixes bug where updates would not always get applied before a LIMIT 0 or a WHERE false.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Packaging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed java dependencies to use <code>java-11</code> metapackage provided by both openjdk and oracle java.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Misc</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update jetty to <code>9.4.51.v20230217</code> for <code>CVE-2023-26048</code></li>
</ul>
