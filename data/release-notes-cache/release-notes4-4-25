									Neo4j 4.4.25 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.

<h3>Kernel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Better handle transaction log corruption where header is missing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cypher</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug in fused pipelined runtime that could lead to lost updates if a property was cached. For example when running queries like <code>MATCH (n) WITH n.prop AS oldValue SET n.prop = n.prop + 1 WITH n.prop AS newValue RETURN *</code> concurrently. Note, Cypher will not always prevent lost updates, <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/transaction-management/#transactions-isolation-lostupdates">see documentation</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Fixes two bugs around durations with fractional components. Negation was not properly propagated to the components, so that “-P0.5Y” was presented as 6 months rather than -6 months. Fractional minutes &gt; 60 was not properly converted into hours, so that 1 h 72.5 min was presented as 1h 12 min 30s instead of 2h 12 min 30s.
Update Apache Shiro to 1.12.0</li>
<li>Fixes neo4j/neo4j#13155, neo4j/neo4j#13189 and neo4j/neo4j#13191 where shadowing variables in SKIP and LIMIT caused unexpected errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Browser</h3>
<ul>
<li>SSO papercuts (more logs &amp; make downloading them easier)</li>
<li>Fix bug where :auto hint would not show</li>
<li>Fix bug where metadata was incorrectly formatted</li>
</ul>
