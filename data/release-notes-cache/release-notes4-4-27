									Neo4j 4.4.27 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.

<h3>Kernel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixes an issue where terminating the creation of a Constraint, would not also terminate the creation of the backing Index.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where <code>neo4j-admin import</code> import could run on an online database. This could result in not seeing the imported data until after a restart.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cypher</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix possible deadlock in transaction termination</li>
<li>Improved planning of pattern predicates that previously werenâ€™t using <code>Argument</code>.</li>
<li>Solve a bug where Cypher queries containing related equalities in different scopes, e.g. <code>WHERE any(x IN [1, 2, 3] WHERE a.prop = toInteger(x)) AND a.prop = b.prop</code> would fail with <code>Variable ... not defined</code>. Disable the transitiveEqualities rewriter if the <code>WHERE</code> clause contains multiple scopes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Docker</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix where neo4j.conf without a trailing new line would get <code>NEO4J_PLUGINS</code> settings wrongly appended causing startup failure.</li>
</ul>
