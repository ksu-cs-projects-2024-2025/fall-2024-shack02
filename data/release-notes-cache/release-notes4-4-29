<ul>
<li>Solve <a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/13113">https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/13113</a> by allowing convertible types in reduce. E.g. RETURN reduce(a=[1], b in “a” | a+b) will return [1, “a”] instead of failing with a type error.</li>
<li>Fix bug in type checking where the resulting type of a list concatenation could vary depending on which list was to the left and right, respectively, as reported in <a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/13093">https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/13093</a></li>

<li>Respect <code>visible</code> field in SSO provider configuration.</li>
<li>Only show non-composite aliases in database dropdown</li>
<li>Update outdated documentation links</li>
