									Neo4j 4.3.6 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.
<h3>Highlights</h3>

<ul>
   <li>Fixes a bug in node index seek on a unique property in write queries. For example MATCH (n:Node) WHERE n.unique IN [‘does not exist’, ‘exists’] DELETE DETACH n would fail to delete nodes if there is a unique constraint on unique and at least one predicate does not match any nodes.</li>
   <li>Fixes an issue where neo4j-admin passed arguments in @ that contained a large amount of arguments (e.g for import)</li>
   <li>Don’t plan NodeHashJoin for argument variable</li>

</ul>
