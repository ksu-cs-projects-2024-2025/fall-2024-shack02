									Neo4j 3.5.27 is a maintenance release with many important improvements and fixes.
<h3>Highlights</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Update jetty to address security vulnerability CVE-2020-27223</li>
  <li>Update Jackson to 2.10.5.1 to address CVE-2020-25649</li>
  <li>Upgrade to Apache Shiro 1.7.1</li>
  <li>Fix some corner cases where unhelpful exceptions were thrown when a transaction would read a deleted entity lazily. The entity could have been deleted by this or some other concurrent transaction. We now throw ReadAndDeleteTransactionConflictException from the embedded API, and TransientException (which tells clients to retry their transactions) from the driver (Bolt) API</li>
